I presented this project during the 2018 Intel International Science and Enginering Fair. 

The project investigates and evaluates the effectiveness of multiple machine learning algorithms and neural networks in processing data contained in the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).
